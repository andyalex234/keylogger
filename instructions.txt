1. --------find_event_file.c---------------
Every keyboard has its own layout. The layout of a keyboard is called keyboard bitmap. Usually linux
stores an event file that is associated with the event bitmap in /dev/inputs/ system directory.
The main logic here we followed is we
    a/ got all the events defined on the keyboard from linux /dev/inputs/ system directory
    b/ checked for sample int32_t characters on events
    c/ returned a keyboard layout character by character
